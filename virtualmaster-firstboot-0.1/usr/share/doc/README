Virtualmaster

    By Josef Liska <jl@chl.cz>


Introduction
------------
Virtualmaster package is a set of scripts to kickoff freshly installed
virtual machine. Most of tasks are performed only once, on first boot.
Idea of this package is to have one universal distro-independent config
file and then set of distro-specific packages (e.g. .deb, .rpm, .tgz).

Main tasks are:
- set up networking (IP, gateway, nameservers) on first booot
- resize root filesystem to actual size of partition
- ensure swap partition has swap signature
- set root's password
- optionaly create users and add ssh keys

Filelist
--------
/etc/virtualmaster.cfg
/etc/init.d/virtualmaster
/etc/virtualmaster/*.tpl
